Exile Addons - originally small projects developed for the Arma Exile communities EXO and SP4R but now rewritten and collected here for public use. 

I'll gradually add all features I built, encouragements always helps the project to stay alive a little longer :smirk: | [Donate here](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=jan%2ebabor%2e383%40gmail%2ecom&lc=GB&item_name=ExAd&currency_code=EUR&bn=PP%2dDonationsBF%3abtn_donate_SM%2egif%3aNonHosted)

## Installation & Examples
Instructions for installation is found under [docs](https://github.com/Bjanski/ExAd/tree/master/docs). 
Each plugin must be installed seperately, I've done it this way to make the update procedure easier. 
Below you can see what dependencies each plugin has. 

## Update Instructions
After you have installed the entire or parts of the ExAd Package you will easiest update by checking each subproject documentation folder to retrieve the changelog and update instructions.
